There are a total of eight different element formulation and the naming convention is as follows:

"Q1" denotes quadrilateral bilinear elements.
"E5" denotes elements implenented with the enhanced assumed strain (EAS) method, where the "5" stands for the number of internal degrees of freedom.
"Ax" denotes simply that the elements are axisymmetric.
"SS" denotes small strain elements.
"FS" denotes finite strain elements.
"P" denotes elastoplastic elements.

All AceGen files also come with a Fortran file, which has been generated using the corresponding AceGen notebook in "Optimal" mode. 
Both finite strain plasticity elements also come with a debug version, which can be found in the "Debug versions FS P" folder. All folders of these finite strain plasticity elements also include four extra Fortran files for the material model.
